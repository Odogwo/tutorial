Although it is easy to define and fit a deep learning neural network model, it can be challenging to get good performance on a specific predictive modeling problem.

There are standard techniques that you can use to improve the learning, reduce overfitting, and make better predictions with your deep learning model.

Hereâ€™s how to get started with getting better deep learning performance:

Step 1: Discover the challenge of deep learning.

There is a logical way to lay out the topics in mathematics that build on each other and lead through a natural progression in skills, capability, and understanding.

The problem is, this logical progression might only make sense to those who are already on the other side and can intuit the relationships between the topics.

The problem is, the logical progression through the material may not be the best way to learn the material in order to be productive.

We are not robots executing a learning program. We are emotional humans that need motivation, interest, attention, encouragement, and results.

You can learn technical subjects from the bottom-up, and a small percentage of people do prefer things this way, but it is not the only way.

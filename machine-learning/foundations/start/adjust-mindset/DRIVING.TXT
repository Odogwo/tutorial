I remember hiring a driving instructor and doing driving lessons. Every single lesson was practical, in the car, practicing the skill I was required to master, driving the vehicle in traffic.

Here’s what I did not study or discuss with my driving instructor:

The history of the automobile.
The theory of combustion engines.
The common mechanical faults in cars.
The electrical system of the car.
The theory of traffic flows.


To this day, I still manage to drive safely without any knowledge on these topics.

In fact, I never expect to learn these topics. I have zero need or interest and they will not help me realize the thing I want and need, which is safe and easy personal mobility.

If the car breaks, I’ll call an expert

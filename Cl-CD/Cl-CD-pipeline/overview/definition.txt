A CI/CD pipeline may sound like overhead, but it isn’t. 

It’s essentially a runnable specification of the steps that any developer needs to perform to deliver a new version of a software product. 

In the absence of an automated pipeline, engineers would still need to perform these steps manually, and hence far less productively


A CI/CD pipeline automates your software delivery process.
 The pipeline builds code, runs tests (CI), and safely deploys a new version of the application (CD).

Automated pipelines remove manual errors, provide standardized feedback loops to developers, and enable fast product iterations

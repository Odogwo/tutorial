The event-driven architecture pattern is a famous distributed asynchronous architecture pattern used to build highly scalable applications. This architecture applies events to trigger and interact among decoupled services and is popular in modern applications developed with microservices. Event-driven architecture can be seen in a shopping cart of an e-commerce website. It carries several events like adding items in the cart, a price change of a product, checkout, payment, shipping, notification of delivery, etc. This kind of architecture facilitates the application to react to changes from a diversity of sources during times of high processing, without impacting the application or over-provisioning resources

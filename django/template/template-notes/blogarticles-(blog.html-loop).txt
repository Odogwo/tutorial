            {% for b in blog %}
                <div class="col-12 pb-4 text-dark">
                    
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>


It's time to render the queryset of articles on the blog.html page. 

Let's start by creating a row and adding the Django template language so we can iterate over the queryset we passed. 

Now add a column within the for loop that has dark text, padding at the bottom, and always takes up the entire row with col-12.

Let's set up the basic structure of the document. Extend the header.html template and add the block content tags.


 Add a division element with the class attributes container py-5. Nest a heading one with the class attribute font-weight-bold within it. Write in "Articles" as the heading text.

  Then add a thematic break and a regular break before the closing tag of the division element. Save the file.

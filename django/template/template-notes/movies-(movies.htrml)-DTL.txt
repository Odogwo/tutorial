   NOTES

   Create a for loop 
   		{% for m in movies %} 

   		movies being the context we passed in the views function 
   		m being the shorthand reference to movies within the loop.

	call on all of the fields we specified earlier in the models.py to render all of the information we added in the Django admin.

		{{m.movie_title}}, 
		{{m.release_year}}, 
		{{m.director}}, 
		{{m.movie_plot}} 
		directly within the HTML elements, as if they were regular text.

	close the for loop with the tag 
		{% endfor %}.

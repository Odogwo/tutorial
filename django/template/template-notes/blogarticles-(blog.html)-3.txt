Within the column, nest a new row that will have two columns, one column for the article image and the other for the article title and text. Add my-auto to both columns so they are vertically centered with one another.


In the first column nest the article image url and in the second column add the article title, publication date, and content. Add |safe to the article_content so TinyMCE will render the text we added to the Django admin then add |truncatewords:25 immediately after to only allow the first 25 words to appear when the article's content is called. The last thing is to add a "View post" button to the right column

WHAT HAPPENED

	env > mysite > main > models.py



NOTES
	movie_poster = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/', null=True)

	a field for uploading images to a model, 
	it just requires a little more configuration to the project. 

	ImageField that specifies the upload will go to a folder named 'images/'. 

	We will also add null=True so the file is not required.

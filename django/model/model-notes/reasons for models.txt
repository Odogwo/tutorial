REQUIRED 
	Django models are technically not required 
	but are highly recommended.

	but are ultimately not required for unchanging or rarely changing site information.


PURPOSE
	It is good practice to use Django models whenever possible to minimize repetitive code 



WHY USE MODELS 
	Use Django models when you need to dynamically load information in your project.


EXAMPLE
	eg article model
	use articletitle, url slug content as fields
	usesame template for each artcle
	that is dynamically loading queryset based on user request

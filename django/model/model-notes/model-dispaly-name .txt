How to change the Django model display nam


EXAMPLE (Movies)
env > mysite > main > models.py

	def __str__(self):
		return self.movie_title

 a function that returns the movie's title as the display name.


 If you forget to add this function it will list Movie object (1), Movie object (2), and so on in the Django admin, making it hard to know which object corresponds to a particular movie.

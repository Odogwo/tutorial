import HTMLField from tinymce.models 

create a new class called Article. 
	add fields article_published and 
	article_content.  

	HTMLField will give us TinyMCE's text editor that comes with a handful of style and formatting features.


article_title as a CharField with a max length of 200

article_image as an ImageField that uploads to the 'images/' directory


article_slug as a SlugField.  A SlugField is similar to a CharField except only letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens are allowed since they are used in URLs.

a function that returns the article_title as the display name in the Django admin like we did with Product.

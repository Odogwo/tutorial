FIRST CHECK

# No reporters are in the system yet.
>>> Reporter.objects.all()
<QuerySet []>


# Now the article is in the database.
>>> Article.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Article: Django is cool>]>




AFTER CREATING

# Fields are represented as attributes on the Python object.
>>> r.full_name
'John Smith






ARTICLE AND REPORTER LINKS (FOREIGN KEY)
# Article objects get API access to related Reporter objects.
>>> r = a.reporter
>>> r.full_name
'John Smith'


# And vice versa: Reporter objects get API access to Article objects.
>>> r.article_set.all()
<QuerySet [<Article: Django is cool>]>




FULL WAY OF CHECKING 

# Django provides a rich database lookup API.

>>> Reporter.objects.get(id=1)
<Reporter: John Smith>
>>> Reporter.objects.get(full_name__startswith='John')
<Reporter: John Smith>
>>> Reporter.objects.get(full_name__contains='mith')
<Reporter: John Smith>
>>> Reporter.objects.get(id=2)

Field Options
Django provides a way to define field options to a model's field. These field options are used to set a value or a constraint, and so on. For example, we can set a default value for a field using default=<value>, to ensure that every time a record is created in the database for the field, it is set to a default value specified by us. Following are the two field options that we have used while defining the Publisher model:

help_text: This is a field option that helps us add descriptive text for a field that gets automatically included for Django forms.
max_length: This option is provided to CharField where it defines the maximum length of the field in terms of the number of characters.
Django has many more field types and field options that can be explored from the extensive official Django documentation
